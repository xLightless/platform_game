# Platform Game
A Platforming Game written in Python as part of an Assingment in Games Development


# Scenario
You have a job as a trainee programmer at a software developer who creates computer games.
You have been asked to write a platforming game that will appeal to children/teens aged around 11-16.
The game involves navigating a character around an area collecting items and avoiding hazards.
Collecting items adds to your score, colliding with hazards uses up lives, of which each game character only has a limited number. 

- Although the game is targeted towards teens, it should have an element of difficulty the further into the game that a player gets. 
Increased difficulty could be done by:
*	Increased hazards/enemies
*	Less time
*	Fewer lives
The game should be exciting and fun to play, as well as visually appealing. Creation of your own assets is a necessity for this assignment. 
Created assets must include:
*	Character/s
*	Hazards
*	Levels
*	Items
